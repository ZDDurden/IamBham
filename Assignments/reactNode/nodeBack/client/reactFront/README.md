Once you've finished the previous lab (client and server side), i want you guys to attempt to create a NEW project that uses an express server and also uses React on the front end. This application should combine some of the things we've done over the last few labs.

1) use react router dom to create routes
2) create one "route" for films where you are pulling in from the ghibli api we used previously
3) have a second route for "forum" where it displays messages (or chirps :wink: ) -- those messages should be pulled in from a json file.
4) Set up your server in such a way that will allow the user to post, update, and delete the messages
5) Make it look pretty!
